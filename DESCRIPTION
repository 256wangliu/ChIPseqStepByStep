Description: Chromatin immuno-precipitation followed by DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) 
    has become the most prevalent high throughput technology for the genome-wide 
    identification of the binding sites of transcription factors and histone 
    modification. In this workshop, attendants will gain knowledge and hands-on 
    experiences on analyzing ChIP-seq dataset using several Bioconductor 
    packages such as ChIPpeakAnno, GeneNetorkBuilder and TrackViewer.
